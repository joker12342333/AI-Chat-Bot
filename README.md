# Building Your PDF Chat Application 🚀

Welcome to our guide on building a modern PDF chat application! This project combines the power of React for a smooth user experience with FastAPI for intelligent PDF processing. Let's dive into how it all works.

## What We're Building 🎯

We're creating an application that lets users chat with their PDF documents, powered by:

### Frontend Magic ✨
- **React** & **TypeScript** for a rock-solid UI
- **Vite** for lightning-fast development
- **Tailwind CSS** for beautiful styling
- **Lucide-React** for sleek icons
- **ESLint** to keep our code clean
- **React Hooks** for state management

### Backend Wizardry 🔮
- **FastAPI** - Our speedy API framework
- **Uvicorn** - Powers our server
- **PyPDF2** - Extracts PDF secrets
- **Sentence-Transformers** - Understands text like a human
- **FAISS (CPU)** - Finds answers at lightning speed
- **Pydantic** - Keeps our data in check
- **Python-Multipart** - Handles file uploads smoothly
- **Python-Dotenv** - Manages our secret sauce

## Let's Build It! 🛠️

### Frontend Journey 🎨

#### 1. Create Your Project
First, let's scaffold our React + TypeScript project:
```bash
npm create vite@latest my-project --template react-ts
```

#### 2. Power Up with Dependencies
Add the tools we need:
```bash
npm install tailwindcss lucide-react react-dom react
npm install -D eslint @vitejs/plugin-react
```

#### 3. Style with Tailwind
Make your app beautiful:
```bash
npx tailwindcss init
```

Add this magic to your `index.css`:
```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

#### 4. Craft Your UI
Build these essential pieces:
- A smooth PDF uploader
- An intuitive query input
- A clean results display

#### 5. Connect to Your Backend
Wire everything together:
- Set up API communication
- Handle those responses like a pro

#### 6. Fire It Up!
Let's see it in action:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Backend Adventure 🏗️

#### 1. Create Your Environment
Set up your Python workspace:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### 2. Gather Your Tools
Install your Python powerups:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install numpy==1.24.3
```

#### 3. Build the Brain 🧠
Implement these crucial features:
- **PDF Processing**: Extract knowledge from PDFs
- **Smart Embeddings**: Transform text into meaning
- **Lightning Search**: Find answers in milliseconds

#### 4. Create Your API Endpoints
Set up these crucial routes:
- `POST /upload`: Welcome new PDFs
- `POST /query`: Answer user questions

#### 5. Launch Your Server
Bring it to life:
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

## Ready to Roll? 🎉

Your PDF chat application is now ready to:
- Process PDFs like a pro
- Answer questions intelligently
- Provide a smooth user experience
